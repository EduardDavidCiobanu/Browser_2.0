    Pizza is a savory dish of Italian origin, consisting of a usually round, flattened base of leavened wheat-based
dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and various other ingredients (anchovies, olives, meat, etc.) baked at a
high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.[1] In formal settings, like a restaurant, pizza is eaten
with knife and fork, but in casual settings it is cut into wedges to be eaten while held in the hand.
Small pizzas are sometimes called pizzettas.

    The term pizza was first recorded in the 10th century in a Latin manuscript from the Southern Italian town of
Gaeta in Lazio, on the border with Campania. Modern pizza was invented in Naples, and the dish and its
variants have since become popular in many countries. It has become one of the most popular foods in the
world and a common fast food item in Europe and North America, available at pizzerias (restaurants specializing
in pizza), restaurants offering Mediterranean cuisine, and via pizza delivery. Many companies sell
ready-baked frozen pizzas to be reheated in an ordinary home oven.
